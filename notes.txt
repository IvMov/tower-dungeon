BUGS: 
1) top down in tunel or min camera distance - projectiles flight through ground -_- (already 10th bug like this) fck
2) sometimes errors(timers can't start for enemies) when move from map with lot of enemies to the shop - need to add some check in enemies timers start to eliminate this erros
3) player can jump and put crystals into fire near fontain
4) sometimes map generates not very well ( one room went to another bounds
5) check push functionality ( when explosion center near enemy - it's not pushed out.
6) when item on cd, and drag and drop it - the view without item will still run timer of cd3
7) when in shop not enough money for (buttons updates view but price left white)
8) when in shop - buy an item - and save exit, then load - item again available in shop
